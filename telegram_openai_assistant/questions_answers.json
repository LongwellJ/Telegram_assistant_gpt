        "answer": "Pneumatic retinopexy (PnR) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to repair certain types of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRD). It was first described over 30 years ago as a two-step outpatient operation without the need for a conjunctival incision. The procedure involves the application of retinopexy (either cryotherapy or laser) to the retinal break before or after the injection of an expansile gas into the vitreous cavity of the eye. This gas bubble helps to reattach the retina by pushing it back against the wall of the eye\u30104:2\u2020source\u3011.",
